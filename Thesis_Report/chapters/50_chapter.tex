While several \ac{MPPT} algorithms where studied in relation to this thesis , three of the most common ones were selected to be tested in this thesis. It was observed that each of the selected algorithms had one or more shortcoming when implemented on \ac{DSCs}

This paper presents a new algorithm for tracking maximum power point in photovoltaic systems. This is a fast tracking algorithm, where an initial approximation of \ac{MPP} quickly achieved using a variable step-size. Subsequently, the exact\ac{MPP} can be targeted using any conventional method like the hill-climbing or incremental conductance method. Thus, the drawback of a fixed small step-size over the entire tracking range is removed, resulting in reduced number of iterations and much faster tracking compared to conventional methods. \\

My implementation draws inspiration for the above article for its  two-stage algorithm to reduce the number of iterations but deviates significantly in the implementation and algorithms used to identify the \ac{MPP}

**add TEXT important RESEARCH * \\

Typically, MPPT methods utilized in medium and high power PV systems uses measured cell characteristics (current, voltage, power) along with an online search algorithm to compute the corresponding \ac{MPP}. Due to the complexity of the required mathematical operations, a \ac{DSP} or a relatively powerful micro-controller is typically needed, which increases the cost of the system.Moreover, it consumes significant portion of the generated power. Therefore, a\ac{MPPT} circuit with low-cost and fast-tracking features is essential .\\

It has already established that there exists a relation between V\textsubscript{MPP} and V\textsubscript{OC} in equation ~\ref{eq:equ_fracoc} and is famously used in the \ac{FOCV} method. However we see that this does not hold true for all illumination conditions and certainly not for low-light(less than ~1500 Lux ) as compared to higher insolation. Since V\textsubscript{OC} is is a logarithmic function of I\textsubscript{ph}, the relationship between  V\textsubscript{MP} and I\textsubscript{MP}.with respect to irradiation is not linear. However, it is possible to linearize this relationship for an interval where the value of V\textsubscript{OC} is sufficiently insensitive to irradiation. That is, the  \ac{VAL} can be calculated as the tangent line of the \ac{MPP} locus where the sensitivity of V\textsubscript{OC} to I\textsubscript{ph} is lower than a pre-defined threshold. This relationship is illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:Lui_IV_1} on page ~\pageref{fig:Lui_IV_1}.

  The same trend can be seen on the I-V curves for the \ac{DSCs} under test (Figure ~\ref{fig:vmmp_lux50_5000}).

Two new maximum power point tracking algorithms are presented: the input voltage sensor, and duty ratio maximum power point tracking algorithm (ViSD algorithm); and the output voltage sensor, and duty ratio maximum power point tracking algorithm (VoSD algorithm).unlike the incremental conductance algorithm which requires two sensors (the voltage sensor and current sensor), the two algorithms are more desirable because they require only one sensor: the voltage sensor.  \\
