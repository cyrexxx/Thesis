This thesis has been conducted at EXEGER Sweden AB in Stockholm with support from KTH- The Royal Institute of Technology, between the months of January and November of 2014. I would like to acknowledge all the people and institutions that have contributed directly and indirectly to this work.\\

First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to my manager Dr.Camilla Niva for being extremely patient, understanding and for her constant encouragement all through my period here. To Mr.Giovanni Fili, CEO and Dr.Henrik Lindström, CTO; for providing me with this extraordinary opportunity of completing my studies while working at EXEGER.\\

I would like to extend my thanks to Dr.Martin Törngren, for this thesis would be incomplete without his invaluable guidance and critique. A special thanks to Baha Hasan, my supervisor at KTH, who provided me with insightful advice and support.\\ 

I am also grateful to my colleagues Dr.Jarl Nissfolk, Dr.Magdalena Marszalek and Mikael Källberg. They provided rich insights into their respective fields of expertise and contributed to a conducive atmosphere for research.\\
