\chapter{Design and Implementation}
\begin{quote} 
\it This chapter covers the implementation details of the concept, the algorithms. All the simulations were first carried out in MATLAB{\textregistered} and Simulink{\textregistered}, testing and verifying; then implementing the same in Hardware.

\section{Cell Characterisation}
In this section, Model of two types of cells (\ac{a-Si} and \ac{DSCs}) is discussed.There are several Models that have been analysed in literature which are usually variations of the Single Diode model or the Double Diode model (discussed in section \ref{sec:SDM},\ref{sec:DDM} and \ref{sec:eDDM}).
 
\subsection{Test Setup}
in **furtherance of** creating a working solar cell model and to validate the algorithm several measurements would need to be performed. The Test-rig consisted of a blacked out enclosure to prevent **interference** from ambient light. The Test-rig is fitted with an array of evenly spaced White-\ac{LED}s to provide uniform illumination on the Test subject. The \ac{LED}-array are calibrated and temperature controlled so as to provide white light with a known spectra. A high precision Lux Meter(\textit{GOSSEN Mavolux 5032B}) is used to measure the  intensity of the light, as perceived by the human eye.The Light chamber is also routinely calibrated against a reference cell to factor-in the variations and degradation of the \ac{LED}s. The intensity of light is varied using a High-Voltage power source.A pictorial representation of the above description can be seen is figure  ~\ref{fig:test setup} on page ~\pageref{fig:test setup}. \\

As the Sink Voltage is increased in small steps from 0 V to V\textsubscript{OC} and beyond the cell is forced to operate at the Sink Voltage resulting in the I-V graph depicted in figure ~\ref{fig:2500luxIV} on page ~\pageref{fig:2500luxIV}.
When the above is repeated for several different light intensities we get a three-dimensional surface shown in figure ~\ref{fig:luxIV100_2500} on page ~\pageref{fig:luxIV100_2500}\\

However due to the near impossibility of accurately measuring all the variables of a unknown cell for this research work,a model was constructed by placing a the test cell under a battery of varied illuminations (0 Lux - 5050 Lux) shown in figure ~\ref{fig:Voltagevlux} . Which resulted in a surface that closely resembles the cell's operation in real world conditions. particular attention was paid to low light conditions which is to be expected for indoor illuminations ( < 2000 Lux).As \ac{DSCs} display are very stable output across a large temperature range, the above model was made independent of temperature variations.
