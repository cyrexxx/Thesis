abstract={ The paper derives the performance equation of a high speed distance relay which is based upon the theory of symmetrical components. A single equation is shown to be adequate for handling all types of faults which are likely to occur on a three-phase power system. Errors created by system loading and fault-path resistance are considered. A numerical example illustrates the principle of operation of the relay. The relay is especially suited to a digital computer based protection system.},
