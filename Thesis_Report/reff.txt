 %This article aims to assess different MPPT techniques, provide background knowledge, implementation topology, grid interconnection of PV and solar microinverter 
requirements presented in the literature, doing in depth comparisons between them with a brief discussion. The MPPT merits, demerits and classification, which can 
be used as a reference for future research related to optimizing the solar power generation, are also discussed.\\

 Typically, MPPT methods utilized in medium and high power PV systems uses measured cell characteristics (current, voltage, power) along with an 
online search algorithm to compute the corresponding \ac{MPP}. Due to the complexity of the required mathematical operations, a \ac{DSP} or a relatively 
powerful micro-controller is typically needed, which increases the cost of the system.Moreover, it consumes significant portion of the generated power.

 Two new maximum power point tracking algorithms are presented: the input voltage sensor, and duty ratio maximum power point tracking algorithm (ViSD algorithm); and the output voltage sensor, 
and duty ratio maximum power point tracking algorithm (VoSD algorithm).unlike the incremental conductance algorithm which requires two sensors (the voltage sensor and current sensor), 
the two algorithms are more desirable because they require only one sensor: the voltage sensor.  \\
